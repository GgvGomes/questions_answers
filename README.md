Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## About the project

The project was created to be used at a conference (in this case it was a church), the idea was that people could ask questions to the speakers quickly and easily. It's worth noting that the idea worked really well.
This part of the project is just the front-end, the back-end was created in a separate partition for security and management reasons.
As the idea of â€‹â€‹the project is to help the public, it is ðŸ“±responsiveðŸ“±! At least in terms of asking questions. They can only be viewed on a computer, in this case we use the computer of the person who was featured in the media.
If you need something similar, feel free to use it.
